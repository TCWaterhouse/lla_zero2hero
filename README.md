## Notes
- read database, make sure its valid and correct
- read all employees into memory
- depending on flags, do certain actions to database
- add, delete, update (-a, -d, -u)
- database file name, new database (-f, -n)
- with unix better to use flags instead of lots of stdout and stdin calls
- otherwise becomes hard to understand and what to expect
- makes it easier to automate with bash scripts etc.
